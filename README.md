## Project Goal 

The goal for this project was to create a simple review site where users can select or add a music product to review. 
Users can create an account and see reviews of other users for different gear.
This site makes for a very convenient and quick way for users to review and see reviews for different music equipment they are interested to purchasin.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### Overall Client Goals

1. To be able to search for items within the database
2. To be able leave reviews for different items within the database
3. To be able to add new products to the database, if a user cannot see their desired product

#### First Time Visit Goals

1. To be able to sign up to the site with a unique username and password
2. To be able to leave/delete their own reviews for a specific product

#### Returning Visitor Goals

1. To be able to have a unique account that they can login into (created from signing up)
2. To be able to edit their account information, i.e. username and password
3. To be able to view their own reviews easily.
4. To be able to delete their personal accounts if they wish

#### Typography

The Website primarily uses 3 different fonts throughout, obtained from Google Fonts. These fonts were:

Bungee Tint ('sans-serif')
Montserrat ('sans-serif')
New Amsterdam ('sans-serif')

"Bungee Tint" is used for the title page, as it is a very stylish looking font.

"Montserrat" is used as the default font for the website text, and "New Amsterdam" is used for the titles of each page, as it is a much bolder looking font, while not being as overly stylistic as "Bungee Tint."

### Features

#### Main User Features

* Upon entering the size, the user is greeted with the home page, which just welcomes the user.

![Home Page](docs/readme-images/home-page.png)

* The user has the option, to sign up, login, or search for a product by either filtering through, brands, categories, or search for a specific item using the search bar.
* If the user hasn't already, they can sign up using the sign section. This stores, their username, email, and hashed password within the database

![Sign Up](docs/readme-images/sign-up.png)

* Once they sign up, they can then log in and access their own personal account.

![Login](docs/readme-images//login-page.png)

* They now have access to their own account dashboard, which allows them to view and edit their username and email, as well as give them the option to change their password, or even delete their account

![Dashboard](docs/readme-images/dashboard.png)

* Users can also see all the reviews they have written inside it's own "Your Reviews" section.

![User Reviews](docs/readme-images/your-reviews.png)

* Users can search for products and see reviews written by other users, and if they have an account they can write a review themselves

![Search](docs/readme-images/search-results.png)
![About Gear](docs/readme-images/about-gear.png)

* Users also have the option to add a new product to the system, which themselves and other users can write reviews on.

![Add Product](docs/readme-images/add-product.png)

* Users are also able to update and delete their own reviews

![Update Review](docs/readme-images/edit-review.png)
![Delete Review](docs/readme-images/delete-review.png)

* As well as the search bar, the user is also able to browse through the categories and brands in order to find the item they are looking for
  * Brands:
![Brands](docs/readme-images/brands.png)
![Brands Gear List](docs/readme-images/brand-gear-list.png)
  * Categories:
![Categories](docs/readme-images/categories.png)
![Category Gear List](docs/readme-images/category-gear-list.png)

#### Validation

* Measures have been implemented so that users are always unable to access pages that they should. This could be, for example, a user being able to another user's dashboard, being able to edit and delete other people's reviews, or regular users access admin only pages and functions.

* If a user ever manages to find themselves accessing the URL of a page they shouldn't, they will be immediately booted out and an error message will display.

![Unauthorized](docs/readme-images/not-authorised.png)

* A similar feature is implement should a user try to access an account functionality when not logged in. For example, a user cannot leave a review should they not be logged in, nor can they access any dashboards, as well as other features.

![Login Required](docs/readme-images/login-required.png)

* If the user trys to sign up using an existing email or username, then it was display a flash error message and reload the sign up page

![Sign Up Error](docs/readme-images/sign-up-error.png)

* Likewise, if the user tries to write a review for a product they have already reviewed, then it'll redirect the user and display a flash message.

![Review Duplicate](docs/readme-images/review-duplicate-message.png)

##### 

#### Admin Only Features

* If a user is also an admin user, then they will have access to significantly more functonality. 
* This includes, being able to add, edit and delete brands and categories from the database.

![Admin Brands](docs/readme-images/admin-brands.png)
![Admin Categories](docs/readme-images/admin-categories.png)

* Admin users are also able to search through users and access their dashboards, close user accounts, and edit or delete any review

![Search Users](docs/readme-images/search-users.png)
![User Dashboard](docs/readme-images/dashboard-admin.png)

#### Potential Future Feautures

Some potential features that I would like to include include:

* Admin users being able to change whether other users are admin or not
* More interactivity, such as having a phyical star rating that they can select, rather than a drop down 0-5 menu
* I would have liked to add some time stamps on the user reviews, so that people can see the times they were created/edited

8. Choose "Settings", and click "Reveal Config Vars"
9. Here you can add your environment variables, including your IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, and DATABASE_URL
10. Try not to include a DEBUG varible here, or if you do, make sure it is set to False
11. Go to "Deploy", and if you want, you can select "Enable Automatic Deploys", and make sure the branch is set to "main"
